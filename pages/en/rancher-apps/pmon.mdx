# Personal Monitoring

Sometimes you want to monitor resource usage of the Pods deployed in your namespaces. **Personal Monitoring** application allows you to do so in a few easy steps. The application creates a personal Prometheus instance that collects all metrics from your namespace and displays them in a personal Grafana instance located on web address `pmon-[namespace].dyn.cloud.e-infra.cz`.

## Installation

Start with choosing **Personal Monitoring** application from Rancher application menu.

Click `Next`. It is not possible to change deployed chart name as there can exist only one monitoring per namespace.
