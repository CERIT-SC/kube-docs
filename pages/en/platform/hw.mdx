## Storage

Primary network storage consists of four head nodes each equipped with AMD EPYC 7302P, 256GB RAM, 2x 10Gbps NIC (failover only). It offers 500TB all-flash capacity of SSD drives only in RAID 6 equivalent configuration. Used filesystem is IBM Spectrum Scale that is exported via NFS version 3 to the kubernetes cluster.

### Data Backup

Storage is not backed up to another location, however, file system snapshots are made on daily basis, 14 snapshosts are kept. I.e., up to 14 days to the past, we are able to restore deleted/overwritten data.
