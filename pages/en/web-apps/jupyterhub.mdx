# JupyterHub 

It is necessary to be a **valid** member of MetaCentrum to access JupyterHub on [hub.cloud.e-infra.cz](https://hub.cloud.e-infra.cz/).

## MetaCentrum Membership
If you are already a member of MetaCentrum, you can check your membership status in [user profile](https://profile.e-infra.cz/profile/organizations), row `MetaCentrum`. If the account is expired, ask for renewal by clicking on button in the same row.

If you are not a member, you can [apply](https://metavo.metacentrum.cz/en/application/index.html) for a MetaCentrum account.

## Choosing image

We pre-prepared the following images:
- minimal-notebook ([spec](https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using/selecting.html#jupyter-minimal-notebook))
- datascience-notebook ([spec](https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using/selecting.html#jupyter-datascience-notebook))
- scipy-notebook ([spec](https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using/selecting.html#jupyter-scipy-notebook))
- tensorflow-notebook ([spec](https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using/selecting.html#jupyter-tensorflow-notebook))
- tensorflow-notebook with GPU support ([spec](https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using/selecting.html#jupyter-tensorflow-notebook) but TF v. 2.7.0 and TensorBoard installed)
- RStudio with R 4.2.1, 4.3.1, or 4.4.1
- Jupyter environment with Python 3.11 and R 4.3.1 kernels
- MATLAB R2022b
- MATLAB R2023a
- Alphapose

You can choose to build your own image with all dependencies and sotware you need. However, don't forget to include whole jupyter stack, otherwise the the deployment will not work. We recommend building from [existing image](https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using/selecting.html) which already incorporates all nexessary software. If you choose custom image, you have to provide image name together with its repo and optional tag --- input text in format `repo/imagename:tag`. If you build your own image, you have to make sure repository is public. If you don't know what repository to choose, we maintain our own docker registry which you can freely use and does not require any further configuration. More information on registry is available [at a harbor site](https://docs.cerit.io/docs/harbor.html).

### Working environment

If you choose RStudio, you will be redirected to jupyter lab. It is then necessary to click on RStudio icon to be redirected to the RStudio environment. 

![rstudio](/img/ceritsc/apps/jupyterhub/rstudio-click.png)

![rstudio](/img/ceritsc/apps/jupyterhub/rstudio.png)

Other images are redirected to the `/lab` version of JupyterHub.

## Storage
By default, every notebook runs with persistent storage mounted to `/home/jovyan`. Therefore, we recommend to save the data to `/home/jovyan` directory to have them accessible every time notebook is spawned. 

If you create a new named notebook, new persistent storage is mounted to it. If you have ever created a notebook with the same name, new persistent storage is not created but old one is mounted. However, you can choose to delete existing storage which will result in losing all the data from it. Furthermore, you can choose to mount any already existing storage (to `/home/jovyan`) instead of creating a new one which enables sharing data across spawns and instances.

### MetaCentrum home
You can mount your MetaCentrum home --- check the options and select the desired home. Currently, it is possible to mount only one home per notebook. In hub, your home is located in `/home/meta/{meta-username}`.

Possibilities:

brno11-elixir | brno12-cerit | brno14-ceitec 
--- | --- | --- |
brno1-cerit | brno2 | praha1
budejovice1 | du-cesnet | praha2-natur
liberec3-tul | pruhonice1-ibot | praha5-elixir
plzen1 | plzen4-ntis | vestec1-elixir        

❗️ If you choose storage where you do NOT have a home, spawn will fail. Please, make sure you are choosing storage where your home exists. If you are not sure about home location, contact <a href="mailto:k8s@ics.muni.cz">IT Service desk</a> who will help.

## Resources
Each Jupyter notebook can request 3 types of resources --- CPU, memory, GPU --- up to the set limit. Because we want to support effective computing, we have implemented a simple shutdown mechanism that applies to each notebook instance. Please, read the mechanism description below.

#### CPU
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are guaranteed **1 CPU** and can request up to **32 CPU** limit. Resource limits represent a hard limit which means you can't use more than set amount for that specific instance. If computation inside notebook requires more CPUs than assigned, it will not be killed but throttled --- the computation will continue, perhaps just slower.  

#### Memory
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are guaranteed **4G of RAM** and can request up to **256G of RAM**. Resource limits represent a hard limit which means you can't use more than set amount for that specific instance. If computation inside notebook consumes more memory than assigned, it will be killed. The notebook will not disappear but the computation will either error or abruptly end.

#### GPU
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is possible to utilize GPU in your notebook, you can request whole GPU or MIG GPU.

- For whole GPU, **using GPU requires particular setting (e.g. drivers, configuration) so it can be effectively used only in images with GPU support.** (marked as `...with GPU...` in the selection menu). If you assign GPU with any other image, it will not be truly functional.

- For MIG GPU, see [NVIDIA MIG](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/technologies/multi-instance-gpu/) documentation about MIG technology. It is possible to request up to 4 parts of 10GB MIG of NVIDIA A100/80GB card using `10GB part A100` option and up to 4 parts of 20GB MIG of NVIDIA A100/80GB card using `120GB part A100` optino. GPU memory is HW limited so there is no problem that someone else could overutilize requested amount of the resource. Individual MIG parts (up to 4) act as isolated GPUs so to utilize more than one MIG part, multi-GPU computation has to be setup in an application.


### Resource utilization
After providing JupyterHub for more than a year, we have collected enough data to safely state that most of the notebook instances request unreasonably high resource amounts that remain unused but blocked. We believe fine resource utilization is a key factor in effective computing and therefore we have implemented a simple mechanism that decides if your notebook instance will be deleted. It performs evaluations once a day.

If **at least 1 GPU** was requested, the mechanism checks GPU usage and does not care about CPU usage (GPU is a *more expensive* resource). After 2 days of &lt;0.005 GPU usage, the notebook instance is deleted. The threshold `0.005` was chosen because this number is truly insignificant and means no usage. 

If **no GPU** was requested, the mechanism checks only CPU usage. After 7 days of &lt;0.01 CPU usage, the notebook instance is deleted. The threshold was chosen based on data collected by monitoring --- CPU usage below 0.01 suggests that the notebook just exists and no computation is performed.

The mechanism works for both ways as following: 

> Notebook's CPU usage is measured over 24h and is calculated as the average of notebook CPU usage (in CPU seconds) over 5-minute-long segments. The final maximum is chosen from all segments. If the resulting maximum *equals to zero/under 0.01*, the notebook instance is internally marked with "1" as the first warning. If usage is above 0.01, nothing happens.
>
> Notebook's GPU usage is measured over 24h and is calculated as the average portion of time graphics engine was active over 5-minute-long segments. The final maximum is chosen from all segments. If the resulting maximum *equals to zero/under 0.005*, the notebook instance is internally marked with "1" as the first warning. If usage is above 0.005, nothing happens.
> 
>  Next run performs the same but if maximum:
>  - is still less than 0.01 for CPU (0.005 for GPU), counter is increased by one. If counter reaches `threshold+1` (e.g. for CPU, 8 as 7 days have already passed), instance is deleted.
>  - changes from under the threshold above it, the mark is completely removed (you apparently started using notebook again).
>  - is over the threshold, nothing happens.


#### Low usage notification

If the notebook is marked for deletion, you will receive an e-mail informing about the situation for every warning until instance is truly removed. You will get an e-mail informing about deletion as well. You are not forced to do anything about instance if you receive an email --- if the usage does not go up, it will be deleted. We recommend saving the results or copying them elsewhere if you receive a warning. The email is sent to the address configured in your MetaCentrum account as a preferred address.

## Named servers
JupyterHub allows spawning more than one notebook instance; actually you can run multiple instances of various images at the same time. To do so, in the top left corner, go to `File &rarr; Hub Control Panel`. Fill in the `Server name` and click on `Add new server`, you will be presented with input form page. 

![add1](/img/ceritsc/apps/jupyterhub/add1.png)
![add2](/img/ceritsc/apps/jupyterhub/add2.png)

## Conda environment
Conda is supported in all provided images and is activate using `conda init`. New conda environment terminal is created in notebook's terminal with command `conda create -n tenv --yes python=3.8 ipykernel nb_conda_kernels` (`ipykernel nb_conda_kernels` part is required, alternatively irkernel). 

![moveenv](/img/ceritsc/apps/jupyterhub/move_env.png)

Check if environment is installed with `conda env list`. You can use the environment right away, either by creating new notebook or changing the kernel of existing one (tab `Kernel` → `Change Kernel...` and choose the one you want to use).

![checkenv](/img/ceritsc/apps/jupyterhub/check_env.png)
![selenv](/img/ceritsc/apps/jupyterhub/select_env.png)

## Install Conda packages
To install conda packages you have to create new conda environment (as described above). Then, install new packages in terminal into newly created environment e.g. `conda install keyring -n myenv`. 

Open new notebook and change the kernel in tab `Kernel` → `Change Kernel...` → `myenv` (or the nemae of kernel you installed packages into).


## Error handling
You receive _HTTP 500:Internal Server Error_ when accessing the URL `/user/your_name`. Most likely, this error is caused by:
1. You chose MetaCentrum home you haven't used before - The red 500 Error is followed by `Error in Authenticator.pre_spawn_start`
2. You chose MetaCentrum home you don't have access to - The red 500 Error is followed by `Error in Authenticator.pre_spawn_start`
3. While spawning, `Error: ImagePullBackOff` appears

Solutions:
1. Log out and log in back
2. You can not access the home even after logging out and back in - you are not permitted to use this particular home
3. Clicking on small arrow `Event log` provides more information. Most certainly, a message tagged `[Warning]` is somewhere among all of them and it provides more description. It is highly possible the repo and/or image name is misspelled. 
 - please wait for 10 minutes
 - The service has a timeout of 10 minutes and during this time, it is trying to create all necessary resources. Due to error, creation won't succeed and after 10 minutes you will see red progress bars with message `Spawn failed: pod/jupyter-[username] did not start in 600 seconds!`. At this point, it is sufficient to reload the page and click on `Relaunch server`.

## Deleting Notebook Instance

In the top left corner, go to `File ` &rarr; `Hub Control Panel` and click red `Stop My Server`. In a couple of seconds, your container notebook instance will be deleted (stop button disapperas). If you need to spin notebook instance again, fill in the `Server name` and click on `Add new server`, you will be presented with input form page. 

All of your named server are accessible under `Hub Control panel` where you can manipulate with them (create, delete, log in to).

## Feature requests
Any tips for features or new notebook types are welcomed at <a href="mailto:k8s@ics.muni.cz">IT Service desk</a>.

## Building Own Image

The best and easiest way for building custom image is to base minimal notebook from jupyterhub `jupyter/minimal-notebook:hub-4.0.2` and do necessary changes. Source for our Minimal notebook can be found [here](/examples/ceritsc/jupyterhub/Dockerfile-minimal).

If for any reason, it is not desired to source this minimal notebook, you can create a new one from any base, but make it sure it is ready to run as notebook:

* Install `jupyterlab` package
* Add [start-notebook.py](/examples/ceritsc/jupyterhub/start-notebook.py), [start-notebook.sh](/examples/ceritsc/jupyterhub/start-notebook.sh), [start-singleuser.py](/examples/ceritsc/jupyterhub/start-singleuser.py), [start-singleuser.sh](/examples/ceritsc/jupyterhub/start-singleuser.sh), [start.sh](/examples/ceritsc/jupyterhub/start.sh) files to `/usr/local/bin` and make them executable `chown a+rx start*`
* Make sure, that these `start` files are not eddited on Windows and having Windows new lines. Google for solution by requesting: windows vs unix newline.


## Notebook sharing

If you want to share a notebook with another user or use it from another browser session, you need to open `Hub Control Panel` as can be seen below:

![control](/img/ceritsc/apps/jupyterhub/token1.png)

Then select the `Token` menu:

![token](/img/ceritsc/apps/jupyterhub/token2.png)

Then put a name for the token (arrow 1 below), hit `Request new API token` button (arrow 2 below), and you will see the token (arrow 3 below):

![token2](/img/ceritsc/apps/jupyterhub/token3.png)

Check the current URL in your browser, it should look like:

![url](/img/ceritsc/apps/jupyterhub/token4.png)

Copy the URL, from the very beginning to the `lab`, including the `lab`, e.g., select the part: `hub.cloud.e-infra.cz/user/xhejtman/AI/lab`. Extend this URL with token as follows:

![urltoken](/img/ceritsc/apps/jupyterhub/token5.png)

I.e., add `?token=86c4dc52fa4e4d6298c4ba7d008fc085` (with your token instead of the `86c4dc52fa4e4d6298c4ba7d008fc085`). Send it to friend or open it in another browser.

<Callout type="info">
The URL will be redirected so that the part `?token=XXX` is hidden, so you will not be able to copy it again once displayed in the browser.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
The token is valid for all your running notebooks, not just for a particular notebook. So be careful when sharing.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
The user who wants to use the share link with the token must not be logged in, e.g., must use an incognito browser window.
</Callout>

## AI GPT Support

Some of the notebooks (marked with `AI`) are integrated with GPT, in particular the gpt-4o-mini model. Each user has access to prepaid the model with the following restrictions:

* The model can only be used from the jupyterhub (the API key will not work anyway).

* The user can currently spend $1 per month (for the gpt-4o-mini model, the limit is for 1.3M input+output tokens).

* Using the GPT requires the user to agree to the [OpenAI terms of use](https://openai.com/policies/terms-of-use/). 

* Only the gpt-4o-mini model is supported.

<Callout type="warning">
Your data will be sent to the third party service -- OpenAI. If you do not agree, do not use AI versions of notebooks.
</Callout>

### Currently Integrated Notebooks

* Minimal NB AI -- see [https://jupyter-ai.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://jupyter-ai.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for documentation.

## Notebook SSH Access

<Callout type="warning">
SSH access works only from IPv6 enabled networks. It will not work from IPv4 only network -- most home networks, you usually will need to use VPN service such as Edu VPN.
</Callout>

It is possible to enable SSH access at notebook startup, you need to use an image that contains `sshd` with correct settings, currently `Minimal NB with SSH access` image is available.

As shown below, ssh enpoint address will be displayed, `jovyan@jupyter-xhejtman---54est.dyn.cloud.e-infra.cz` in this example. Write this address because Jupyterhub UI will not display this address again. It can be obtained by `kubectl get svc -n jupyterhub-[yourlogin]-prod-ns -o yaml | grep external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/hostname`, if the `kubectl` tool is installed in the notebook.

![ssh](/img/ceritsc/apps/jupyterhub/ssh.png)

### SSH Keys

Additionally, you need to add your *public* ssh key into home `.ssh/authorized_keys` file. If the directory `.ssh` does not exist, just create it using `mkdir .ssh`. Do not omit the dot at the beginning of the name. Also note, `ls` does not display doted files, to see `.ssh` directory, you need to use `ls -a`. 

After adding the public ssh key, you should be able to connect with ssh similarly to `ssh jovyan@jupyter-xhejtman---54est.dyn.cloud.e-infra.cz`.

<Callout type="info">
The ssh will print warning about changed ssh key sometimes (mainly after restarting the notebook), this is ok, using the SSH key.<br/>DO NOT IGNORE THIS WARNING WHEN ENTERING A PASSWORD.
</Callout>

### Creating Own SSH Enabled Image

You can easily base our minimal notebook image with the name: `cerit.io/hubs/minimalnb:26-09-2024-ssh`. Or you can create your own from scratch. Follow the guidelines above, how to create own notebook image and additionally install `openssh-server` package.

Put the following configuration into `/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/sshd.conf` or if your base distribution does not use `/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d` then just to `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`:

``` filename="sshd.conf" copy
Port 2222
AddressFamily any
ListenAddress 0.0.0.0
ListenAddress ::
StrictModes no
PubkeyAuthentication yes
UsePAM yes
X11Forwarding no
PrintMotd no
TCPKeepAlive yes
PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes +ssh-rsa
```

Also remove all `/etc/ssh/ssh_host_*` files in the image.

<Callout type="warning">
It is crucial to remove the `ssh_host_*` files from the image and create new files during image start. Otherwise the ssh connection is not secure!
</Callout>

The last step is to edit original `start-notebook.sh` file located in the image in `/usr/local/bin/start-notebook.sh` and add lines:

```bash copy
(export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=''; 
 rm -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_*; 
 for i in rsa dsa ecdsa ed25519; do 
   ssh-keygen -q -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_${i}_key -N '' -t $i; 
   ssh-keygen -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_${i}_key.pub; 
 done)

LD_LIBRARY_PATH='' /usr/sbin/sshd
```

the whole file should look like this:
```bash filename="start-notebook.sh" copy
#!/bin/bash
# Shim to emit warning and call start-notebook.py
echo "WARNING: Use start-notebook.py instead"

(export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=''; 
 rm -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_*; 
 for i in rsa dsa ecdsa ed25519; do 
   ssh-keygen -q -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_${i}_key -N '' -t $i; 
   ssh-keygen -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_${i}_key.pub; 
 done)

LD_LIBRARY_PATH='' /usr/sbin/sshd

exec /usr/local/bin/start-notebook.py "$@"
```
