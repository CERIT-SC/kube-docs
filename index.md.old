# Welcome to CERIT-SC documetation for Kubernetes and Rancher usage

CERIT-SC's Kubernetes clusters are available for use to all people eligible to login via ELIXIR, EGI or MetaCentrum. 
Everybody has default project in one of the clusters but group projects for team collaboration can be set up as well. To create group project, a _PERUN_ group must exist (in Meta VO) with all intended members.

One can manipulate with cluster through command line tool `kubectl` or graphical user tool _Rancher_. Nevertheless, it is mandatory to log into _Rancher_ to obtain token for command line tool. 

## Operational applications running in Kuberentes 

There are some applications that are not directly used by users but function in containers and are managed in Kubernetes. Numerous applications can be turned into containers and microservices. Currently, we run:

- proxy (the one used for logging into Rancher)
